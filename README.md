# Setup BATS 🦇

A :octocat: GitHub Action to setup [BATS testing framework][bats].

## Usage 🚀

A sample workflow to run tests using [BATS][] (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

``` yaml
name: "CI"
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    name: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Setup BATS
        uses: mig4/setup-bats@v1
        with:
          bats-version: 1.5.0

      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Test
        run: bats -r .
```

### Options 🎨

### Hacking 🧰

#### Building

Install the dependencies  

``` bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript, apply formatting, lint and package the code for
distribution and run unit tests:

```bash
$ npm run all
```

Run the tests separately :heavy_check_mark:  

```bash
$ npm test
...
 PASS  __tests__/installer.test.ts
  installer tests
    ✓ Acquires version of BATS if no matching version is installed (1051ms)
    ✓ Throws if no matching version of BATS can be found (674ms)
```

#### Code

The `action.yml` file defines the inputs and output, description, etc. of the
action.

See the documentation:

- [Metadata syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)
- [Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages)

#### Publishing to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so the branch which will be used at runtime
needs to have the `dist/` folder checked-in. It's recommended for users to only
refer to released versions instead of consuming master directly.

The distribution is created with [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) which can
be invoked via:

``` bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod package"
```

Now to release a new minor/patch versions (replace `.x.y` as appropriate):

``` bash
# update "version" property in `package.json`
$ npm install
$ npm run all
$ git add -A
$ git commit -v -m "Release v1.x.y"
$ git push
$ git tag -s v1.x.y
$ git tag -fs v1 -m "Update v1 tag"
$ git push --tags --force
```

For the tag to be published to marketplace you need to create a release from
it which you can do by going into _Releases_ in GitHub UI, then _Tags_ and
clicking the menu next to the newly created tag and select _Create release_.
Alternatively use the URL (replace `x.y` as appropriate):
https://github.com/mig4/setup-bats/releases/new?tag=v1.x.y

The action is now published! :rocket:
